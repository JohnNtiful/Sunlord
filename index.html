            <center><p><b><u>Who Was Steve Jobs?</u></b></p></center>
            <p>Steve Jobs was an American inventor, designer, and entrepreneur who was the cofounder, 
                chief executive, and chairman of Apple Inc. Born in 1955 to two University of Wisconsin graduate 
                students who gave him up for adoption, Jobs was smart but directionless, dropping out of college and experimenting
                with different pursuits before cofounding Apple with Steve Wozniak in 1976. Jobs left the company in 1985, launching Pixar
                Animation Studios, then returned to Apple more than a decade later. The tech giant’s revolutionary products, which include the iPhone, 
                iPad, and iPod, have dictated the evolution of modern technology. Jobs died in 2011 following a long battle with pancreatic cancer.</p>

            <h3><b>Jobs’ Parents and Adoption</b></h3>
            <p>Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco to Joanne Schieble (later Joanne Simpson) 
               and Abdulfattah “John” Jandali, two University of Wisconsin graduate students. The couple gave up their 
               unnamed son for adoption. As an infant, Jobs was adopted by Clara and Paul Jobs and named Steven Paul Jobs. 
               Clara worked as an accountant, and Paul was a Coast Guard veteran and machinist.

                Jobs’ biological father, Jandali, was a Syrian political science professor. His biological mother, Schieble, 
                worked as a speech therapist. Shortly after Jobs was placed for adoption, his biological parents married and 
                had another child, Mona Simpson. It was not until Jobs was 27 that he was able to uncover information on his biological parents.</p>
            
                <p><h2>Steve Jobs and the Birth of the iPhone</h2></p>
                A Visionary's Dream

                Steve Jobs, the charismatic co-founder of Apple, had a vision for a device that would seamlessly blend the capabilities of a phone,
                a personal computer, and a portable music player. This vision, nurtured over years, culminated in the creation of the revolutionary 
                iPhone.Jobs' journey toward the iPhone began in the late 1970s when he and Steve Wozniak founded Apple. The company's early success 
                with the Apple II, one of the first personal computers to gain widespread popularity, laid the groundwork for future innovations.
                The iPhone was a product of its time, drawing inspiration from several technological advancements. The iPod, Apple's groundbreaking 
                digital music player, demonstrated the company's expertise in portable devices. The touchscreen technology pioneered by companies 
                like Palm and the graphical user interface (GUI) popularized by Apple's Macintosh computer provided the foundation for a new kind 
                of user experience.

       at the Macworld Conference in San Francisco, Steve Jobs took the stage and introduced the world to the iPhone. The device's sleek design, groundbreaking 
       touchscreen interface, and innovative app store captivated audiences.</p>
